## Individual Contributions

### Previous Week Goals

**Oliver:** Begin implementing the homepage for the website as assigned.

**Henry:** Finish up the UI design for the website.

**Thao:** Work with Henry to finish the UI design.

**Celestine:**  Begin implementing the homepage for the website as assigned.

**Jeremy:** Will evaluate the UI and break it up to tickets to assign to people. Will work on writing documentation on setting up the repository, how to run the react application locally, write up how to use git properly, and setting up PRs and expectations.

### Progress and Issues

**Oliver:** Added sidebar and course categories on sidebar with new classtab component. Another merge made it so the category buttons were under the header, so that needed to be fixed.

**Henry:** Finished Home page, classes page, login page, sign up page UI design. Also reviewed and reworked some of the designs made by Thao. Still having the problem of not being able to load the React application on my computer.

**Thao:** Drafted UI designs for login/sign up page and submitting reviews, collected UW CSE courses and info and formatted them into a Google Spreadsheet, started working on UI implementation.

**Celestine:** Added issues for UI bugs found in the header and sidebar and sent pull requests of my fixes and merged both after review. Coded the background to the homepage. Worked heavily on the Architecture and Design documentation, as well as the detailed project schedule. Had a slight delay in merging a pull request due to miscommunication about our pull request review system, which was resolved. Team had trouble clarifying architecture and design, so I went to the professor for guidance.

**Jeremy:** Got documentation done and in the Google Drive. Also broke up some of the UI into tickets where people have begun picking them up. Also helped Oliver set up branch rules and resolve any issues with that. Trying to help Henry get his React application working locally. I’ve been reviewing PRs and making sure we have a standard procedure for creating branches/PRs and reviewing them.


### Next Week Goals

**Oliver:** Continue working on UI implementation, especially the login page.

**Henry:** Finish design for Classes page, figure out the React issue.

**Thao:** Continue working on UI implementation, maybe start putting in UW CSE courses into the database.

**Celestine:** Continue working on UI implementation, especially the homepage. Hope to get started on programming directory pages and the API for database requests once the homepage is complete.

**Jeremy:** Start to get the database set up on AWS. Main goal is to get Henry’s environment properly set up since he is the last one that is not able to.
